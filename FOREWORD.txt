my thoughts on the foreword section:

i don't feel empowered by staring at a glowing piece of plastic

it is true i have to be cautious while programming in c/c++

are you sure they are friendly? i've read that rust has a steep learning curve

already knew what parallelism/concurrency meant in high school but didn't know the words for them

i've owned a rasberry pi before but i don't know how to build a business out of rasberry pi s

i am not a member of the rust community until i finish the book
